SQL*Plus: Release 10.2.0.4.0 - Production

Copyright (c) 1982, 2007, Oracle.  All Rights Reserved.

Usage 1: sqlplus -H | -V

    -H		   Displays the SQL*Plus version and the
		   usage help.
    -V		   Displays the SQL*Plus version.

Usage 2: sqlplus [ [<option>] [<logon>] [<start>] ]

  <option> is: [-C <version>] [-L] [-M "<options>"] [-R <level>] [-S]

    -C <version>   Sets the compatibility of affected commands to the
		   version specified by <version>.  The version has
		   the form "x.y[.z]".	For example, -C 10.2.0
    -L		   Attempts to log on just once, instead of
		   reprompting on error.
    -M "<options>" Sets automatic HTML markup of output.  The options
		   have the form:
		   HTML [ON|OFF] [HEAD text] [BODY text] [TABLE text]
		   [ENTMAP {ON|OFF}] [SPOOL {ON|OFF}] [PRE[FORMAT] {ON|OFF}]
    -R <level>	   Sets restricted mode to disable SQL*Plus commands
		   that interact with the file system.	The level can
		   be 1, 2 or 3.  The most restrictive is -R 3 which
		   disables all user commands interacting with the
		   file system.
    -S		   Sets silent mode which suppresses the display of
		   the SQL*Plus banner, prompts, and echoing of
		   commands.

  <logon> is: (<username>[/<password>][@<connect_identifier>] | /)
	      [AS SYSDBA | AS SYSOPER] | /NOLOG

    Specifies the database account username, password and connect
    identifier for the database connection.  Without a connect
    identifier, SQL*Plus connects to the default database.

    The AS SYSDBA and AS SYSOPER options are database administration
    privileges.

    The /NOLOG option starts SQL*Plus without connecting to a
    database.

  <start> is: @<URL>|<filename>[.<ext>] [<parameter> ...]

    Runs the specified SQL*Plus script from a web server (URL) or the
    local file system (filename.ext) with specified parameters that
    will be assigned to substitution variables in the script.

When SQL*Plus starts, and after CONNECT commands, the site profile
(e.g. $ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin/glogin.sql) and the user profile
(e.g. login.sql in the working directory) are run.  The files may
contain SQL*Plus commands.

Refer to the SQL*Plus User's Guide and Reference for more information.
