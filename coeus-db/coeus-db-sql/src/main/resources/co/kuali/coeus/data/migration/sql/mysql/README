*****************************************************
Mysql installation instructions for the current release.
******************************************************

This folder contains the scripts for the installation of the current KC version, from all KC versions

******************************************
Upgrade from V1 to V3
******************************************
Bundled rice
******************************************
Please run ALL the scripts for EACH release in the release order against your kc database.
So if you want to get from V1 to V3 where V1 < V2 < V3, run in the following order
to get from V1 to V3.

V2_mysql_rice_server_upgrade.sql
V2_mysql_rice_client_upgrade.sql
V2_mysql_kc_rice_server_upgrade.sql
V2_mysql_kc_upgrade.sql
V2_mysql_kc_demo.sql

Once on V2, do the same for V3. Now your database would have been upgraded from V1 -> V2 -> V3.


******************************************
Standalone rice
******************************************
If you did not upgrade your rice server separately, the same instructions from above apply, you run the above scripts in the same order but the rice scripts should be run against the rice db instead of the
kc db.

*****
NOTE
*****
1. It is OK if some files are missing, just run the ones that are present in the order listed above.
2. Please be aware that two log files will be created in the directory where you launch sqlplus from.
You can check these logs for errors once the scripts finish.
3. Do not skip any versions, this is only an incremental upgrade path, you cannot upgrade directly from a version to any version other than the one immediately after.
