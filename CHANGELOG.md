*  Suppress notification if business rule failure on data override
  * In the Kualico instance, the system still presents the Data Override Notification even if entered item was invalid.The Notice should NOT be sent.
  * Steps:
  * In an enroute proposal; OSP admin uses Data Override. Example: Award ID:
  * If user enters a value in the 'change' field that does not match the valid criteria (too few #/, too long, not a true Award ID) the system outlines the field in red and presents an error warning in the window; but the user can still click 'create override'; the window closes, and the Notification window still presents to alert Aggregator of override. But the override did NOT occur.
  * The Notification window should NOT be generated if the override did not occur.
  * In the MIT QA instance, the data override notification "prompt user' is NOT CHECKED. So these incorrect notices are being sent.
  * The RESKC-485 case fixes the issue of the override validation error message not appearing on the proposal screen when the override modal window closes.
  * This case is to fix the notice from being generated when the override action is not performed due to invalid/incomplete entry.

*  Allow same person to be added under different roles.
  * As an Award Maintainer, I need to set up new, and maintain existing Awards.
  * When adding Unit and Sponsor Contacts, I sometimes need to add the person to multiple project roles. This usually occurs with small/independent industrial and foundation sponsors in the Sponsor Contacts; and with small internal departments in the Unit Contacts panel.
  * Currently, the system will not let me add the same person to multiple roles. I get an error message on the top of the page, and a specific error above the panel identifying the person saying they are already added to contacts.

  * Steps to reproduce:
  * 1 Either create a new award, or open an existing award in Edit mode.
  * 2 Select a Transaction type on the Award panel.
  * 3 Click the Contacts tab to open
  * 4 Expand the Sponsor Contacts panel.
  * 5 Search for an address book person to add; select a project role; Add.
  * 6 Search the address book again for the same id added in step 5; select a different project role. Add.
  * Result: Error on page and above panel stating that the person already exists.
  * Desired Result: Allow duplicates for all Award contacts; Sponsor, Unit, Central Admin.

* copy over modular budgets when proposal is copied

  * As a proposal aggregator, I need to copy proposals & budgets. When I copy a proposal & budget with a modular budget filled with details that were either manually added or sync'd from the detailed budget, that screen is not being copied to the new proposal. If I am trying to quickly prepare a change/corrected s2s submission, this missing information will cause another error at the sponsor.

  * Confirmed problem in res-demo1 1505.47 05-20-2015 10:49

  * Steps to duplicate:
  * Locate or create a proposal & budget with the Budget > Modular screen completed.
  * Example: #553 in res-demo1.
  * Copy the proposal> select to copy for submission budget (or version with modular complete)
  * In the new proposal (example #554); notice the following:
  * S2S opportunity >Forms > Optional Modular Budget form still checked to 'include'
  * Budget > Budget Settings > Modular checkbox still checked
  * Budget > Modular Budget screen > blank. No details copied.

  * 5 click search
  * 6. select the person from the list and click return value
  * 7. click [initiate report] for Current - view results on screen
  * Expected results:
  * A single row for each award maintained as "current" displaying the obligated amount from the award.
  * Actual result:
  * Some awards are showing double the amount obligated. In Kualico, some other multiple of the current obligated is appearing.

*  STE in dataoverride when using award id
  * As an OSP Contract Administrator and proposal approver, I need to use data override to correct information on routing proposals (defined in the maintenance doc 'proposal dev editable columns).

  * To duplicate;
  * As Quickstart in res-demo1, open a proposal in approval pending status
  * Open DataOverride from toolbar
  * Select Award ID
  * Enter the 12 digit award id
  * When I enter a valid award id, it takes it. If I enter an invalid one, the modal shows an error but if I go ahead and submit, I either get a STE or screen goes blank.

* disable autocalculate, and syns/recalculate modular budgets when in view only mode

  * When proposal is opened in view mode, budget is also opened in view mode but user has access to generate all periods and sync, calculate buttons are enabled in modular budget.

  * Case 1: Proposal is opened by someone with view access only
  * Case 2: Proposal is opened with Search proposals: view link, regardless of user’s access
  * Case 3: User with budget creator access opens a budget currently being edited by another user (locked for editing view status)
  * In all cases, the sync to modular information is saved.
  * In some cases, the institutional commitments reset to default button result is saved. (If only this button is clicked, results don’t save. If the viewer also clicks the sync button in modular section, the reset to default action is saved.)
  * In all cases, the autocalculate function will run, but the results will not save on return to/close proposal action.

  * Steps to reproduce:
  * 1. As quickstart, create a proposal with NIH as sponsor. Add PI Nicolas Majors. Add users oblood and chew as Budget
  * Creators Add user psmock as Viewer.
  * 2. Save and close. Logout.

  * For Case 1: Proposal is opened by someone with view access only
  * 1. Login as oblood. Create budget version named < oblood version >. Add non‐personnel item, period 1 only. Save, return to proposal. Close (yes to save). Logout.
  * 2. Login as psmock. Click Budget in left navigation bar. Click on oblood version to open. Navigate to modular section. Click ‘sync’. Budget information for Period 1 is synced. Click autocalculate periods link. Budget for all periods is generated (confirm by viewing Budget Summary). Click return to proposal. Close (btw: user is prompted for save, but this prompt shouldn’t happen in view mode).

  * Case 2: Proposal is opened with Search proposals: view link, regardless of user’s access
  * 1. Login as chew. Create budget version named < chew version >. Complete salary detail for Majors. Add personnel item for Majors with 10% effort, 5% charged. Add non‐personnel item Materials & Services $50,000. In Institutional Commitments, Cost Sharing section, Period 1: enter 100 for Percentage, < dept1 > for Source account. Save. Return to proposal. Close (yes to save). Logout.
  * 2. Login as quickstart. Use Search Proposal link, enter proposal number, click ‘view’ from the results Actions options. Click Budget. Open chew version. Navigate to Institutional Commitments. Click reset to default button. Information for percentage and source is cleared. Navigate to Modular section. Click sync. Information for period 1 is synced.

  * Case 3: User with budget creator access opens a budget currently being edited by another user (locked for editing view status)
  * 1. Login as oblood. Open proposal. Create new budget version < oblood 2 >. Add non‐personnel item Materials & Services, $50,000. Save.
  * 2. Open a new incognito or private browsing window. Login as chew. Open the same proposal. Open oblood 2 budget version. Navigate to Modular section. Click ‘sync’. Information syncs and saves. (Since proposal is locked for editing, sync button should not be active.) Click autocalculate all periods link. Budget information for all periods is generated (confirm by viewing Budget Summary).

  * Results: Action buttons are available to user when budget is accessed in View Mode
  * Expected Results: These action buttons should not appear, since action should only be available to users when editing.

  * Select TBA from the 'search for' list option

  * Expected result: the list of maintained To Be Named persons should present with the ability to select how many to apply.

  * Current result: the field updates to To Be Named, but the rest of the modal window does not generate. There is only a letter-box window containing this type field. User cannot add a TBA person to the budget.

*  Do not show cancelled award docs in T&M history
  * As an award administrator, I may need to cancel an award edit transaction instead of saving or submitting. The information may be incomplete, incorrect, or I may have selected the wrong award/node by mistake. I should be able to use the cancel button on the Actions panel to completely delete any updates or changes.

  * Steps:

  * Open existing award
  * Go to time and money and check history, note current version number and update timestamp/user
  * Return to award and click edit
  * Go to award actions and click cancel
  * Reopen award
  * Go to time and money and check history: cancelled award version will now be listed

  * Expected Result: all evidence of the cancelled document are removed from the Award, T&M, or Award Budget documents.
  * Currently, any cancelled documents are appearing as a Version in the T&M History panel.

* Fix award budget versioning issues

  * When versioning awards the budgets need to stay with the original award, but new awards need to display all budgets. Additionally the budget creation process wasn't looking at the correct list of budgets and only the current awards budgets which meant it could easily ignore previously posted budgets.

*  fix award budget issues
  * Award budget documents seem to be attached to a particular sequence of the award and when new award sequences are created you can no longer view the budget created on an earlier sequence. Such as today account 2388937. When this happens users are also able to create new budget versions in the new award sequence regardless of the status of the earlier budget version. So now account 2388937 has two budget documents 1440820 and 1439251. Which again, shouldn't affect our work or SAP but I don't think this is how we want this to work.
  * Award budget totals when editing / versioning an award are not right either.

* Validation for eRA Commons User Name is based on sponsor group NIH

  * Currently any proposal that has a sponsor under the 'NIH Multiple PI' Sponsor Hierarchy will require the eRA Commons username for PD/PIs, and if missing it will throw the following validation: eRA Commons User Name is missing for <insert PI name>.

  * Originally we tied this validation to the 'NIH Multiple PI' sponsor hierarchy, but since schools may be using this hierarchy for all sponsors (not just NIH) we need to tie this validation to another hierarchy.

* fix rolodex persistence through sponsor maintenance document

  * Scenario:
  * 1 - Create a new Sponsor
  * 2 - Add Sponsor and Address details
  * 3 - Submit new Sponsor
  * 4 - Search for new Sponsor and open inquiry.

  * Result:
  * When the inquiry is opened you can see that a new rolodex record has been created but there is no address book information. If you try searching for the address book record, you can only copy the record, not edit it.

  * Expected Behavior:
  * 1 - The address book entry details should be saved when the sponsor record saves.
  * 2 - The address book record should be editable from the address book lookup.

  * 3) Click 'edit' next to any result
  * 4) Enter a description on the Document Overview tab and then edit the Description in the Edit Budget Category tab
  * 5) Click either 'submit' or ' blanket approve'

  * Actual results:

  * User is redirected to an Incident Report screen with the following error: Error Details: OJB operation; bad SQL grammar []; nested exception is com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Unknown column 'budgetCategoryTypeCode' in 'where clause'

  * Expected results:

  * Document should go directly to final and record should be updated with the users changes.

  * User acceptance criteria:

  * Given a system administrator has to edit a budget category, when the appropriate edits are made and submitted, then the budget category is updated with my changes.

*  Do not regenerate periods if periods already exist!
  * As an award budget user, when I create a rebudget (new version of posted budget with no change to authorized amount), I expect to have all the budget details from the last posted version appear in the rebudget. I should be reducing funds from the existing line items and redistributing that amount to current or new line items, confined to matching the preexisting authorized total.
  * Current (4/29/15) release is not copying the posted budget details to the rebudget; the rebudget is blank, only letting me search for an IP to link details or manually reenter all items. This is not the intended functionality, and not consistent with prior releases.
  * Steps to recreate:
  * Kuali.com demo1 site on 4/29/2015. Award *73-00001, acct id 2533529
  * As Quickstart:
  * Locate an existing award or create a new award with T&M values maintained.
  * Create an initial Award Budget, match to auth total: Actions> submit;
  * As JTester:
  * Action list: Award budget link:Actions> approve the award budget.
  * As Quickstart:
  * Open Award Budget: Actions > post.
  * Open Award > Open Budget Versions
  * To create the rebudget (new AB without change to T&M).
  * -click 'new' to create the rebudget documument
  * result:
  * The new 'rebudget' is not populated with the details entered in the prior approved/posted version.
  * Thus, all the manually entered the details (or modified pulled in PD budget details) are lost, requiring the AB admin to do all the work over again from scratch.
  * The system should be copying the budget line item details forward to the rebudget; users should only be required to shift funds (reduce some line items to rebudget to another) to meet the authorized amount.
  * Rebudget had been working in previous tests: I have done a rebudget where I put in negative value in an existing detail line item to the add that value to another or new line item.

* validate attachment status when submitting to sponsor

  * There is a parameter for Proposal Development named AUDIT_INCOMPLETE_PROPOSAL_ATTACHMENTS that has the following description:
  * "When set to Y, proposals will be audited for incomplete attachments up to and including sponsor submission. When set to N, incomplete attachments are valid on a proposal up to but excluding sponsor submission."
  * When this flag is set to N, a proposal can be successfully routed with an incomplete attachment, but there is no validation upon submission to sponsor that the status has been set to complete. On the KualiCo QA instance running build 1505.4, I was able to submit a proposal with an incomplete attachment without any warnings or errors; see attached screenshot.
  * In the KC 1504.3 release, there appeared to be some validation logic that was intended to prevent submission with incomplete attachments (in the class org.kuali.coeus.propdev.impl.core.SubmitToSponsorRule) but it was buggy; upon submitting a proposal with an incomplete attachment, the data validation window would pop up but would contain no errors, and the proposal would go into "approved" state but no IP would be generated. So it seems that the logic in SubmitToSponsorRule was partially working, but no indication of this error was given to the user and the proposal was not prevented from entering the "approved" state.
  * In 1505.4 it seems as though this partial validation has been removed.

* When opening subaward for award use edit mode

  * Link to Subaward in the Award funding should open with edit button if user has appropriate role/permissions
  * Award modifiers should be able to edit an existing subaward via the awards module by selecting subawards -> Open subaward and then an edit button. The edit button is currently missing from this page.
  * Steps to Reproduce
  * Open an Award Document that has subaward funding (ex 6703 in https://res-demo1.kuali.co)
  * go to the Subawards panel on Award Tab
  * Click on the Open Subaward link in the Subawards where this awared is a Funding source subpanel.
  * Scroll to the bottom of the subaward document and look for the edit button.
  * RESULT: Only close button appears. Even though user has role/permission to create & edit subawards, the edit button is missing.
  * EXPECTED RESULT: User with appropriate role/permission should see an edit button in the subaward document when opening it via the link from awards. This is similar to how the link from subaward to award works when it opens the award and displays the edit button on the award document.

* Fixes autocalculate dates error with dates not exactly the same as the period

  * If user adds a budget expense for tba personnel and the dates are not the same as the budget period start and end dates, then the autocalculate does not get dates for any budget items in additional years correct.

steps to reproduce

    create a proposal with basic requirements to start make sure period is for at least two years
    add a budget
    add personnel: one tba data entry assistant and one tba programmer
    give personnel salary
    navigate to assign personnel
    add programmer object code as post-doc
    effort and charge is 100
    period type is calendar
    add the tba data entry personnel
    add data entry personnel object code as post-doc
    change dates to be three months summer (6/1-8/31 of that year)
    effort and charge is 100
    period type is summer
    save and autocalculate periods
    compare period 1 to period 2 and you will see that dates are not for the same months in each of the years.

  * Current Result - Period 2 shows the data entry person and the programmer as starting and ending on the same day when period 1 was set up to show persons starting and ending on different days.

  * Expected result - whatever information (other than amount) entered in period 1 will be the same in out years when user autocalculates, with only the year applicable changing

* Added the ability to view budget summary and print budget forms when proposal is view only

  * As an Approver and an Aggregator, I need to have access to the Budget Printed Reports for all status of proposals.
  * Issue: in the 1504 kuali co release; the Budget > Actions menu (where the Print menu for budget reports is located) does not appear to the user when the proposal is submitted to routing, and stays hidden when the proposal is submitted.
  * For non-s2s proposals, this leaves no method to access budget reports.

  * Scenario:
  * Create a proposal with a detailed budget that is going to an industrial or foundation sponsor.
  * Complete the required information to route the proposal.
  * Submit the proposal to routing.
  * As an APPROVER: attempt to print the Budget Summary Report from the Budget > Actions menu. There is no Action menu.

* added warning message when abstract detail character limit has been reached

  * In a basic proposal, add an Abstract (Layman Abstract type used for test). Use text generator to get a 50,000-character (with spaces) block of text. Copy/paste into abstract details modal (actually called Add Line). Text is truncated at 49,000 characters (with spaces) with no warning message that not all of the text has been pasted.
  * User Story:
  * As a user, I would like to have a warning message that I have reached a system limit for entering text, especially so that I do not assume my entire selection has been pasted into the limited space.
  * Something like << Data entry for this field is limited to 49,000 characters (with spaces). >> would cover both the situation of a person typing directly into the field and hitting the limit, and a user pasting a block of text from another source.

* scale attachment collections better with page resize

  * The new kualico ui, many of the screens redraw when in edit/add mode, putting several columns/buttons out of the window view, requiring scrolling.

  * When I add attachments, I must now use the scroll bar to find/have access to the Details/Edit/Delete options, as well as other columns (userid/timestamp).
  * If I compress the browser window, there is no compacting or wrapping of any column to aid in using a smaller screen.
  * I have to have the browser window open to at least 14.5 inches to see all the columns. If I compact the left navigation bar to icon mode, I still have to have the window at 13 inches to see all columns. (Chrome on a PC)
  * IE, I was able to see all in a 10.5 inch screen if I used icons for left nav bar.

  * Once a user gets the 10-20 narratives uploaded for an NIH submission, they will need to scroll down to get to the horizontal scroll bar, and then scroll back up to get to the Actions column to edit the attachments.
  * The white space is nice, but the row number column could be smaller, as can the Description column. Any ability to wrap text would also help if a user wanted to/had to work in a smaller window.

  * Can something be done to address the expanding window content? Like allowing these columns to text-wrap? In Add Attachments - reducing the column width of the Description field?

  * Adds a Multiple Choice question type to the Questionnaire framework. Utilizes a new table to store the multiple choice prompts and descriptions, respectively. Uses the MAX_ANSWERS fields to determine whether the question renders as a set of checkboxes or radio buttons.

  * Additional bugfixes:
* Fixed question deletion causing a constraint violation where a question has an explanation.
* Fixed proper form initialization based on the Response type where the first time a question page was loaded the page would display incorrectly until the response type was changed.
* Fixed the read only display not showing the correct dynamic information based on response type.  This was common when viewing after routing.

  * Other:
  * Cleaned up questionnaire maintenance code that is no longer used as of KC 6.0

* scale attachment collections better with page resize

  * The new kualico ui, many of the screens redraw when in edit/add mode, putting several columns/buttons out of the window view, requiring scrolling.

  * When I add attachments, I must now use the scroll bar to find/have access to the Details/Edit/Delete options, as well as other columns (userid/timestamp).
  * If I compress the browser window, there is no compacting or wrapping of any column to aid in using a smaller screen.
  * I have to have the browser window open to at least 14.5 inches to see all the columns. If I compact the left navigation bar to icon mode, I still have to have the window at 13 inches to see all columns. (Chrome on a PC)
  * IE, I was able to see all in a 10.5 inch screen if I used icons for left nav bar.

  * Once a user gets the 10-20 narratives uploaded for an NIH submission, they will need to scroll down to get to the horizontal scroll bar, and then scroll back up to get to the Actions column to edit the attachments.
  * The white space is nice, but the row number column could be smaller, as can the Description column. Any ability to wrap text would also help if a user wanted to/had to work in a smaller window.

  * Can something be done to address the expanding window content? Like allowing these columns to text-wrap? In Add Attachments - reducing the column width of the Description field?

* Fixes autocalculate dates error with dates not exactly the same as the period

  * If user adds a budget expense for tba personnel and the dates are not the same as the budget period start and end dates, then the autocalculate does not get dates for any budget items in additional years correct.

steps to reproduce

    create a proposal with basic requirements to start make sure period is for at least two years
    add a budget
    add personnel: one tba data entry assistant and one tba programmer
    give personnel salary
    navigate to assign personnel
    add programmer object code as post-doc
    effort and charge is 100
    period type is calendar
    add the tba data entry personnel
    add data entry personnel object code as post-doc
    change dates to be three months summer (6/1-8/31 of that year)
    effort and charge is 100
    period type is summer
    save and autocalculate periods
    compare period 1 to period 2 and you will see that dates are not for the same months in each of the years.

  * Current Result - Period 2 shows the data entry person and the programmer as starting and ending on the same day when period 1 was set up to show persons starting and ending on different days.

  * Expected result - whatever information (other than amount) entered in period 1 will be the same in out years when user autocalculates, with only the year applicable changing

  * https://github.com/kuali/kc/pull/1581

  * [KRAFDBCK-12386] Disabled hard error on save for inactive Sponsors in IP and replaced with an audit warning.

  * This code change provides a solution to the problem of trying to edit IPs with Sponsors that have been inactivated since the IP was first approved, by replacing the hard save error with an audit warning instead.

* When opening subaward for award use edit mode

  * Link to Subaward in the Award funding should open with edit button if user has appropriate role/permissions
  * Award modifiers should be able to edit an existing subaward via the awards module by selecting subawards -> Open subaward and then an edit button. The edit button is currently missing from this page.
  * Steps to Reproduce
  * Open an Award Document that has subaward funding (ex 6703 in https://res-demo1.kuali.co)
  * go to the Subawards panel on Award Tab
  * Click on the Open Subaward link in the Subawards where this awared is a Funding source subpanel.
  * Scroll to the bottom of the subaward document and look for the edit button.
  * RESULT: Only close button appears. Even though user has role/permission to create & edit subawards, the edit button is missing.
  * EXPECTED RESULT: User with appropriate role/permission should see an edit button in the subaward document when opening it via the link from awards. This is similar to how the link from subaward to award works when it opens the award and displays the edit button on the award document.

* validate attachment status when submitting to sponsor

  * There is a parameter for Proposal Development named AUDIT_INCOMPLETE_PROPOSAL_ATTACHMENTS that has the following description:
  * "When set to Y, proposals will be audited for incomplete attachments up to and including sponsor submission. When set to N, incomplete attachments are valid on a proposal up to but excluding sponsor submission."
  * When this flag is set to N, a proposal can be successfully routed with an incomplete attachment, but there is no validation upon submission to sponsor that the status has been set to complete. On the KualiCo QA instance running build 1505.4, I was able to submit a proposal with an incomplete attachment without any warnings or errors; see attached screenshot.
  * In the KC 1504.3 release, there appeared to be some validation logic that was intended to prevent submission with incomplete attachments (in the class org.kuali.coeus.propdev.impl.core.SubmitToSponsorRule) but it was buggy; upon submitting a proposal with an incomplete attachment, the data validation window would pop up but would contain no errors, and the proposal would go into "approved" state but no IP would be generated. So it seems that the logic in SubmitToSponsorRule was partially working, but no indication of this error was given to the user and the proposal was not prevented from entering the "approved" state.
  * In 1505.4 it seems as though this partial validation has been removed.

  * As Quickstart:
  * Locate an existing award or create a new award with T&M values maintained.
  * Create an initial Award Budget, match to auth total: Actions> submit;
  * As JTester:
  * Action list: Award budget link:Actions> approve the award budget.
  * As Quickstart:
  * Open Award Budget: Actions > post.
  * Open Award > Open Budget Versions
  * To create the rebudget (new AB without change to T&M).
  * -click 'new' to create the rebudget documument
  * result:
  * The new 'rebudget' is not populated with the details entered in the prior approved/posted version.
  * Thus, all the manually entered the details (or modified pulled in PD budget details) are lost, requiring the AB admin to do all the work over again from scratch.
  * The system should be copying the budget line item details forward to the rebudget; users should only be required to shift funds (reduce some line items to rebudget to another) to meet the authorized amount.
  * Rebudget had been working in previous tests: I have done a rebudget where I put in negative value in an existing detail line item to the add that value to another or new line item.

* fix rolodex persistence through sponsor maintenance document

  * Scenario:
  * 1 - Create a new Sponsor
  * 2 - Add Sponsor and Address details
  * 3 - Submit new Sponsor
  * 4 - Search for new Sponsor and open inquiry.

  * Result:
  * When the inquiry is opened you can see that a new rolodex record has been created but there is no address book information. If you try searching for the address book record, you can only copy the record, not edit it.

  * Expected Behavior:
  * 1 - The address book entry details should be saved when the sponsor record saves.
  * 2 - The address book record should be editable from the address book lookup.
